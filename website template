The Web3 Developer Stack:
The front-end (what users interact with). The back-end (what users don’t see) wallet sdk. Database (where critical data is stored) of encrypted decentralized L2 stack. It’s under the hood where web2 and web3 differ. The backend frameworks and types of databases that make web3’s defining characteristic “user-defined ownership” possible are new and unique. Building on Bitcoin is entirely different from building on Ethereum, and Solana differs from Ethereum, etc. For faster and lower-cost applications, developers might want to build on a layer2 protocol. For applications that need to port value from one chain to another, developers will want to leverage cross-chain bridges. Once these decisions are made, developers can start to incorporate building blocks that make user applications possible .The next thing a developer needs to figure out is how their application will ultimately interact with the underlying blockchains. This is where infrastructure primitives come into play:
*Node infrastructure*  -physical place Dapp’s interact with a blockchain. They’re computers that read the state of the blockchain and write updates to it once a user interacts with an application. Node infrastructure providers like Coinbase Cloud, Infura, and Alchemy: let developers easily set-up, manage, or access blockchain nodes, saving developers considerable time and resources.
*Wallet & Key Management* — Blockchain wallets allow users to manage the private keys needed to perform transactions within web3 applications. Wallet and key management providers enable developers to build secure connectivity between blockchain wallets and user-facing applications.
*Identity* — protocols like EthereumNameService serve as a user’s identity across applications providing frameworks that developers can use to verify user credentials to authenticate actions on Ethereum.
*Decentralized compute* — Compute resources provide processing power that applications rely on to carry out computational tasks. Currently, most of the web’s compute is provided by centrally owned providers like AmazonWebServices. Decentralized compute is a shift towards community-owned networks, in which compute resources are distributed in a permissionless manner at low-cost. Companies have emerged to provide peer-to-peer compute resources that are highly-performant and optimized for smart contracts and blockchain applications.
*Decentralized storage* — Storing every piece of data associated with a given web3 app directly on blockchain nodes is costly. Rather than storing data on a centralized database, web3 developers can use peer-to-peer data storage protocols like IPFS.
*Oracles* — For a typical Ethereum application, the blockchain stores transaction history and “state” (balances, smart contracts, and other variables). It can’t, however, natively store and interact with data from external sources — i.e. transaction history from other blockchains or “real world” data like the weather in San Francisco. That’s where oracles like Chainlink come in, connecting blockchains to on-chain and off-chain data sources.
*Interoperability* — many different blockchains exist but few have the ability to exchange value and make use of information cross-chain. Interoperability protocols like LayerZero provide SDKs and APis for developers to build apps that are portable and can communicate with different blockchains.
"Developer tools" Atop the infrastructure primitives that allow applications to interact with blockchain networks are tools that allow developers to more seamlessly interact with the above-named primitives

 The original structure of the Lehman Formula is a 5-4-3-2-1 ladder, as follows:
5% of the first $1 million involved in the transaction
4% of the second $1 million
3% of the third $1 million
2% of the fourth $1 million
1% of everything thereafter (above $4 million)
Today and to keep up with inflation, investment bankers often seek some multiple of the original Lehman Formula, such as the double Lehman Formula. This structure is also more common in middle market transactions because of their complexity and longer close periods.
10% of the first $1 million involved in the transaction
8% of the second $1 million
6% of the third $1 million
4% of the fourth $1 million
2% of everything thereafter (above $4 million)

$1B Raise (for tokenized bank acquisition):
First $4M: $100,000 + $80,000 + $60,000 + $40,000 = $280,000
Remaining $996M: 2% = $19,920,000
Total fee: $20,200,000 / 2.02%apr

CompoundV3 is an EVM compatible protocol that enables supplying of crypto assets as collateral in order to borrow the base asset. Accounts can also earn interest by supplying the base asset to the protocol. The initial deployment is on EthereumVirtualMachine and the base asset is Aave yield bearing tokens. Please join the #development room in the Compound community Discord server as well as the forums at comp.xyz; Compound Labs and members of the community will provide assistance with building an application on top of CompoundV3.

"caUSDCv3"

This is the main proxy contract for interacting with the market. The address is fixed and independent from future upgrades to the market. It is an OpenZeppelin TransparentUpgradeableProxy contract. In addition to swaps and wrapping, the bulker contract can also transfer collateral within the protocol and claim rewards. Following developer guides and code repositories serve as resources for community members building with Compound. They detail the protocol deployment process, construction of new features, and code examples for implementing external apps that depend on CompoundV3 as infrastructure.
